# Rock-Paper-Scissor
The rules of the game are as follows:-
1. The players can enter any number of digits as they want one by one.
2. Then they enter the number of bit within that number of digits.
3. From then the program will calculate the given bit is Rock, Paper or
Scissor.
4. Then by comparing both the results it will decide the winner.
